from . import Operation

##  An operation that groups several other operations together.

#   The intent of this operation is to hide an underlying chain of operations
#   from the user if they correspond to only one interaction with the user, such
#   as an operation applied to multiple scene nodes or a re-arrangement of
#   multiple items in the scene.
